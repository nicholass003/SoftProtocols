<h1>üåê SoftProtocols - Protocol Version Compatibility Plugin</h1>

<p align="center">
A lightweight PocketMine-MP plugin that <strong>exclusively handles protocol version compatibility</strong> during the initial handshake, allowing players with slightly different Minecraft Bedrock versions to connect while maintaining all other packet behaviors unchanged.

## üöÄ Key Feature

> [!WARNING]
> **Protocol Handshake Only**  
> This plugin only modifies the version negotiation process during the **initial handshake**.  
> It does **not** touch gameplay packets, compression, or encryption.

---

## üß© Supported Protocol Versions

| Protocol | Minecraft Version     | Notes             |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 818      | 1.21.90 ‚Äì 1.21.92      | Minor Extension   |
| 819      | 1.21.93                | Primary Supported |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Intercepts only the `RequestNetworkSettingsPacket` (handshake)
2. Validates against configured protocol versions
3. Modifies **only the version check** while keeping:
   - All other packet handling intact
   - Original compression settings
   - Standard encryption flow
   - Unchanged gameplay behavior

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Client->>Server: RequestNetworkSettingsPacket
    Server->>SoftProtocols: Version Check
    alt Version Supported
        SoftProtocols->>Server: Modified Acceptance
        Server->>Client: NetworkSettingsPacket
    else Version Unsupported
        Server->>Client: Disconnect
    end
```

## üì• Installation

1. Download the latest `SoftProtocols.phar`
2. Place it inside your `/plugins/` folder
3. Restart your PocketMine-MP server

## üìå Important Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ‚ö† This is **not a full version compatibility layer**
> SoftProtocols does **not** handle:
>
> * Packet structure changes
> * Gameplay mechanics or feature parity
> * Block/entity/item remapping

> [!TIP]
> ‚úÖ Recommended Use Case:
>
> * For minor version differences (e.g., 1.21.90 ‚Üî 1.21.93)
> * When client/server features are almost identical

---

## üõ† Configuration

No config file needed.
Edit the supported protocols directly in `SoftProtocols.php`:

```php
public const SUPPORTED_PROTOCOLS = [
    818,  // Original version
    819   // Newer compatible version
    // Add ONLY minor version differences
];
```
